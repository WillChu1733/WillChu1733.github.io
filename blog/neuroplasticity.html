        <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>
          <p>If you understand the principles of neuroplasticity, then you are more likely to be able to influence your development in a more positive direction. The more the brain is exercised, the stronger and more connected it becomes. We can exercise these connections through consistently practicing a skill or challenging ourselves with the intention of improving overtime </p>

      <div class="identity-value">
        <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit</h3>
          <p>By selecting an activity that is new, understanding that improvement will take time, work on increasing his self-awareness by noting self-defeating behaviours as they occur and incorporate mindfulness exercises into daily routines. By observing these thoughts and incorporating self-compassion, rather than self-deprecation we encourage neuroplastic change

        <h1>Research Growth Mindset</h1>
        </div>  
      <div class="identity-value">
        <h2>Discuss what it is and why is it relevant</h2>
          <p>Growth mindset is based on the persons attitude and underlying beliefs regarding learning and intelligence. When that persons believes that can get smarter and understand that time and effort are needed to improve, then they can obtain their goal, whatever that goal is. This is relevant for myself as I am on a journey to become a developer with very little experience. The course is only 15 weeks long and by the end of it, we will have the skills necessary to succeed in the workplace. For this to be possible, our mindset has to be resilient and malleable. We must also have the belief that we can improve and accomplish these goals as long as we put in the time and the effort into this course

          <h7>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h7>
            <p>I am surprised that I have a growth mindset on this course. I am excited to grow and learn every week, which gives me hope in the area that I will be working in the future. This was compared to my previous workplace where I was dreading going into work every day.

            <h8>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey</h8>
              <p>By keeping a positive attitude in all my work. Not worrying about looking dumb by asking questions and embrace all the challenges that will come my way</p>
