        <h1>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>
          <p>A long term goal for myself would be somewhere within the tech industry where I am in a position that is specialised. I'm not 100% sure where I want to be just yet to be honest, but I do know that I want to be in a position where I am good enough at my job that I can teach and guide others. </p>

        <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h2>
          <p>A strength of mine when it comes to learning is that I am a very curious person when it comes to learning something I am interested in or passionate about. I can formulate lots of questions which enables critical thinking and thinking outside the box, which then I spend time researching for an answer or more information. Often times this leaves me having to ask questions which can also be a limitation for myself, as I find it difficult to ask for help. Although I know the facilitators are here to help and understand that we have very limited knowledge in software dev, I don't like to be in the way of people. Another limitation is my attention span. I get side-tracked easily as other websites are only one click away which can take up a lot of time in my day.

        <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
          <p>I would like to work on my relationship building and networking skills in my time here at Dev Academy. I believe that these skills are core to building and creating a successful career in any industry. I strongly believe in the statement: "It's not what you know, it's who you know." as creating meaningful relationships opens up multiple opportunities in life that wouldn't be achievable with just technical skills.</p>

        <h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:<ul>
          <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
          <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
        </ul>
          </h4>
          <p>I will manage my workload in this programme by setting stricter timelines and actively following the timeboxes to complete my work in a quality and timely manner. Currently, I have not been following the timeboxes as I require more time to understand the content fully. I think that currently, what I am doing is fine, but as I progress and have a better understanding of the work, I should follow the time boxes. 
            Minimise distractions by closing all unnecessary tabs. Set small goals for myself so that when I reach these goals, I can take a small break to refresh my mind and mental attitude.
            When things are building up and starting to get to me, I usually take an extended break, such as a snack/lunch break to refresh myself. I come back with a fresh perspective. I take on the tasks one small step at a time so that I don't overwhelm myself with the workload and plan out each task. If I am stuck on a task for an extended period of time I'll try my best to ask facilitators for help. This would be a stepping stone as sometimes it can be difficult to ask for help for tasks that may seem simple for others but difficult for yourself.

          <p>I will make sure that I make a proper attempt at understanding the task and attempting the question. If after a certain amount of time I still donâ€™t understand, I will message the facilitators for help
