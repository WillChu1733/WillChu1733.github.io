        <h1>A time when I was blocked on a problem</h1>
          <p>
            The problem was during sprint 4's tech course where we completed the JavaScript-Kata. I was struggling through the content and although I had completed the work, I wasn't able to apply my knowledge. I broke down the question into smaller parts and approached these small questions individually. I googled tips as well and asked facilitators for help if that still didn't work. I would chatGPT to get more explanations so that I could understand the question better. I felt frustrated as I saw my classmates work and they were able to complete the questions, however, I was so stuck I didn't know where to start. I learnt to slowly break down questions into smaller parts so that it's more approachable, rather than take on the question at face value.

        <h1>A time when I elegantly solved a problem</h1>
          <p>
            FizzBuzz was problem one of the only problems that I solved and understood straight away. I broke down the question, wrote it down and then joined it all back together. It gave me a small boost of confidence and learnt to perservere.

            <ul>
              <li>Psuedocode: I've tried it in a few of the questions, sometimes it becomes a little messy, but I understand the importance of it.</li>
              <li>Trying something: Trial and error. Something I'm more used to</li>
              <li>Rubber Ducky Method: Have attempted it a few times by explaining the process of code, but many times I'll forget and have to look over my notes again</li>
              <li>Reading error messages: I don't understand this one well. Especially when I was practicing Java-Kata. Had many errors that I couldn't understand</li>
              <li>Console.logging: This one I don't really know how to do either. I've tried it but can't figure out where or how to console.log</li>
              <li>Googling: My go to method. I use google for almost everything and read through a few articles and then give my question an attempt</li>
              <li>Asking peers for help: Sometimes difficult, however, everyone is super friendly. I post a question in the chat that I am confused about and people will dm me giving me advice. I appreciate that heaps</li>
              <li>Asking coaches: the real-life chatgpt. I try my best to ask for their help but sometimes am worried I'll ask a stupid question. Like console.log. </li>
              <li>Improving your process with reflection: Very useful to me, sometimes, I'll reflect back on some work and see how much of it I can remember. </li>

        <h1>A time when I reluctantly asked for help. What made me reluctant?</h1>
          <p>
            My last question that I asked, was actually how to console.log. Super embarassed as I don't really understand what we should be putting in the console.log(). Will need to review a lot of work.
