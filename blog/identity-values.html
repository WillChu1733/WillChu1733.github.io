        <h1>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h1>
          <p>Situation where I made an ethical decision was at my previous workplace. The younger colleagues usually have some time where we meet and catch up on any work-related things that we don't like or how the company could improve, basically a rant session. They started talking bad about some of the other colleagues and how they complained a lot. I thought it was quite disrespectful as these colleagues that were being talked about have always treated me kindly and with respect. I stayed out of the conversation and started a different topic with another colleague. Looking back on it now, I could have been more confrontational, but my personality is quite introverted, so it is quite difficult for me to speak up about problems. My values have always been treat each other how you wish to be treated. I always treat everyone with the same amount of respect and so  seeing co-workers I enjoyed working with being disrespected behind their back made me uncomfortable. I think shifting the topic away from the colleagues was a good decision to make, as the rest of the team eventually joined in with the conversation that I had started.</p>

        <h2>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>
          <p>I come from a semi-traditional Chinese family who strongly value family and togetherness. This upbringing has influenced me to have very similar values where I deeply care about my family's wellbeing and health. I want to be able to provide for my parents as they get older. It is also a reason why I decided to move back to Christchurch after working for a year in Wellington. With no family in Wellington, my time there was difficult as there was little support in the city. Acting with integrity is a core value that I have strongly believed and followed in my life. I have been taught from a very early age by my parents that it is best to be honest, no matter the situation.</p>

        <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
          <p>My strengths are strong-relationship building. I believe these strengths support my learning journey by learning through others and creating stronger networks/relationships. This fosters professional growth and collaboration which I believe is the best way to learn. If we all work as a team we can help each other with questions and different projects to learn efficiently</p>

        <h4>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h4>
          <p>A limitation is my ability to concentrate. When I get stuck on a task, I can easily get distracted as entertainment on my pc is one click away. To do this I should eliminate my distractions and work when I am most awake to maximise my efficiency and focus. 
          Time management has not been the strongest point either, however with this course and my willingness to get the most out of this, I believe the intrinsic motivation to do well in this course will motivate me to complete the tasks in a timely but quality manner</p>

        <h5>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h5>
          <p>Back when I worked at PBTech, I was appointed responsible for managing the online orders as the warehouse manager thought I was competent to take responsibility and leadership. Previously, all online orders would be printed out at once which resulted in many orders missing. I introduced a different method and told colleagues to only print out orders they would complete to minimise the risk of losing orders. There were disagreements by one of the colleagues and we discussed and compromised to find an appropriate solution. I decided on this solution as many online order slips went missing or uncompleted for a long period of time as they were printed in bulk and some would get lost. </p>
