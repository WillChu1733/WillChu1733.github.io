              <li> Just because I have a degree, does not mean I will learn faster or better than anyone else in class.</li>
              <li> We all learn at different paces, but it's important that we stay resilient and keep pushing.</li>
              <li> I am able to learn more when pair programming or talking through the task a partner</li>

        <h1>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h1>
          <p>
            values such as integrity is core in learning and programming as we use google everyday to research coding methods. It's important that when we reference the code, that we do not plagiarise, but instead learn from the methods provided by others. 
            The role of empathy is to help us understand our teammates at a deeper level through communication and kindness. This allows us to create stronger relationships and allows collaboration to happen naturally

        <h1>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
          <p>
            Core learning has allowed me to understand and learn more about my emotions and my characterstics a bit better. Examples such as mindfulness, where I am able to just aware of my environment without any judgement calms my emotions and frustrations when programming.

        <h1>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>
          <p>
            Having to think, research, then explain your independent thoughts/reasonings.

        <h1>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h1>
          <p>
            I think that we are focused on core learning because programming as a web developer is only part of being successful at the job. The other part is understanding how you learn and what situations allow you to learn better.

          <h1>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h1>
            <p>
              I think the time I spend studying core learning gives me a break and a refreshment away from programming, that is also beneficial to me as I learn more about awareness, mental health and other valuable core skills.
