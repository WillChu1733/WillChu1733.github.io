        <h1>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h1>
          <p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript can be compared to a Home. HTML provides the structure and foundation to create a building and CSS styles the interior, decorates the walls, decides the furniture etc. They both work together to transform a building into a house. The house becomes a Smart Home with the power of JavaScript, allowing interactivity between the house and the user. Examples such as wifi connectivity to the heat pump, connectivity to the light bulbs etc leads to an interactive environment between the user and the home. </p>

        <h2>An analogy of control flow and loops using examples from everyday life</h2>
          <p><strong>Control flow </strong>is the order of statements, instructions or function calls which are executed using step by step instructions. For example, cooking pasta:
            <ol>
              <li>Boil a pot of water</li>
              <li>Chop vegetables & prepare sauce</li>
              <li>Once water is boiling, add uncooked pasta</li>
              <li>Cook pasta for 8 minutes</li>
              <li>Drain pasta and add to sauce</li>
              <li>Stir and serve pasta</li>
                </ol> </p>
                
          <p><strong>Loops</strong> allow us to repeat a series of instructions until a specific condition is met. For example making coffee for a group of people: 
            <ol>
              <li>determine the number of people you need to make coffee for</li>
              <li>Calculate amount of coffee beans required, based on number of people</li>
              <li>Divide coffee beans into equal portions</li>
              <li>For each person, make a cup of coffee using divided beans</li>
              <li>repeat step 4 until everyone is served</li>
               </ol></p>

        <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it</h3>
          <p>The <strong> Document Object Model </strong> is a programming interface for web documents and allows JavaScript to be integrated with CSS and HTML to make the website interactive. The DOM is made up of nodes and objects (elements, attributes, text, content etc..) so that the programming languages (HTML, CSS, JS) can interact with the page. The DOM is represented by a Window Object and a Document Object. The window object is an interface that represents the browser and the document object is an interface that represents the root of the document itself and everything that lives in the document. We can use the DOM when we want to see or edit the structure of an object in real-time, without permanently saving these changes.</p>

        <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from <strong>arrays</strong> and <strong>objects</strong>.</h4>
          <p>
            <ul>An <strong> Array </strong> is an ordered collection of elements or values, starting at 0, incrementing by one for each element/value in the array. For example, if you have an array of numbers like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and you want to access the third element (which has an index of 2 because indexing starts at 0), you can use the notation myArray[2]. This will return the value 3.</ul>
            <ul>An <strong> Object </strong> is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. The values of an object can be accessed by its associated key. For example, if you have an object with key-value pairs like {name: "John", age: 25}, and you want to access the value associated with the key "name", you can use the notation myObject.name. This will return the value "John". </ul>

        <h5>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful</h5>
          <p>Functions are chunks of code defined into a 'function' that can be used over and over again without having to rewrite the whole line. The function can be called simply using its name to minmise amonut of code written.</p>
