        <h2>Describe the difference between EQ and IQ</h2>
          <p><ul>
            <li>EQ refers to your ability to sense emotion in yourself and in other people. It also refers to how you use that awareness to guide your behaviour. Identify, evaluate, control and express emotions.</li>
            <li>Intelligence quotient measures your ability to problem solve, use logic, process and relay complex information through communication. It is scored through a standardized test. </li>
            </ul>

        <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
          <p>I would like to work on my relationship building and networking skills in my time here at Dev Academy. I believe that these skills are core to building and creating a successful career in any industry. I strongly believe in the statement: "It's not what you know, it's who you know." as creating meaningful relationships opens up multiple opportunities in life that wouldn't be achievable with just technical skills.</p>

        <h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:<ul>
          <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
          <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
        </ul>
          </h4>
          <p>I will manage my workload in this programme by setting stricter timelines and actively following the timeboxes to complete my work in a quality and timely manner. Currently, I have not been following the timeboxes as I require more time to understand the content fully. I think that currently, what I am doing is fine, but as I progress and have a better understanding of the work, I should follow the time boxes. 
            Minimise distractions by closing all unnecessary tabs. Set small goals for myself so that when I reach these goals, I can take a small break to refresh my mind and mental attitude.
            When things are building up and starting to get to me, I usually take an extended break, such as a snack/lunch break to refresh myself. I come back with a fresh perspective. I take on the tasks one small step at a time so that I don't overwhelm myself with the workload and plan out each task. If I am stuck on a task for an extended period of time I'll try my best to ask facilitators for help. This would be a stepping stone as sometimes it can be difficult to ask for help for tasks that may seem simple for others but difficult for yourself.

        <h5>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h5>
          <p>I will make sure that I make a proper attempt at understanding the task and attempting the question. If after a certain amount of time I still donâ€™t understand, I will message the facilitators for help
