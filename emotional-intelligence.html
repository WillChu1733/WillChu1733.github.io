        <h2>Describe the difference between EQ and IQ</h2>
          <p><ul>
            <li>EQ refers to your ability to sense emotion in yourself and in other people. It also refers to how you use that awareness to guide your behaviour. Identify, evaluate, control and express emotions.</li>
            <li>Intelligence quotient measures your ability to problem solve, use logic, process and relay complex information through communication. It is scored through a standardized test. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

      <div class="identity-value">
        <h3>Describe why EQ is important and how it is relevant to you</h3>
          <p>People with high EQ make better leaders and team players because of their ability to understand, empathize, and connect with the people around them. This is relevant to me as a person entering the industry as studies not only show that those who have higher Eqs are likely to have better salaries than their less EQ peers, but also as it is an attractive quality that employers look out for. I want to build my emotional intelligence to open up opportunities and develop my career.</p>

        <h4>Engage and practice mindfulness</h4>
        <p>Mindfulness is a type of meditation in which you focus on being intensely aware of what you're sensing and feeling in the moment without interpretation or judgement. The goal is to notice, without judgement, whatever is here in each present moment. From this awareness and acceptance of things are they are right now, we are better able to make sound decisions</p>

        <h5>Engage and practice conscious listening</h5>
          <p>The act of being intentionally present during communication between yourself and another while being aware of your own and the others feelings and needs
