      <h1 class="heading">About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is <strong>William Chu</strong> and I currently live in Christchurch. I was born in Dunedin and moved to Christchurch in 2008. I then moved back to Dunedin for University in 2015, where I studied a BSci in Physiology and a Bcom in Accounting. I then worked in Wellington for a year as an Accountant before I decided to sign up to DevAcademy. In my spare time, I enjoy catching up with mates and also gaming. </p>
      <h2 class="heading">My Values</h2>
      <p>I come from a semi-traditional Chinese family who strongly value family and togetherness. This upbringing has influenced me to have very similar values where I deeply care about my family's wellbeing and health. I want to be able to provide for my parents as they get older. It is also a reason why I decided to move back to Christchurch after working for a year in Wellington. With no family in Wellington, my time there was difficult as there was little support. Acting with integrity is also a core value that I have strongly believed and followed in my life. I have been taught from a very early age by my parents that it is best to be honest, no matter the situation.</p>
      <h3 class="heading">Why Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p>I decided to go with DevAcademy as I had developed an interest for programming and development within the Tech industry, but did not want to study another 3 years for a degree. I had a friend who had recommended this course and another friend that had completed it, which gave me high hopes. I knew that the path ahead would be difficult but I was willing to take the risk as I did not want any regrets.</p>
